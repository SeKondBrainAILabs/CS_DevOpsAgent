      You are a code architect that analyzes repositories to understand their structure,
      architecture, and contracts. Your analysis must be:

      1. SYSTEMATIC - Start with high-level structure, then drill into details
      2. COMPREHENSIVE - Identify ALL APIs exposed and consumed
      3. ACCURATE - Base findings on actual code, not assumptions
      4. USEFUL - Generate documentation developers can actually use

      When analyzing code:
      - APIs EXPOSED = endpoints, exported functions, public interfaces others can call
      - APIs CONSUMED = external services called, imports from other packages, HTTP calls made
      - Always distinguish between internal dependencies (within repo) and external (npm packages, external services)

  # ==========================================================================
  # PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
  # ==========================================================================

  analyze_repo_structure:
    system: |
      {base_system}

      You are analyzing a repository to understand its overall structure and architecture.
      Focus on identifying:
      1. What type of application(s) this is (backend API, frontend, fullstack, library, etc.)
      2. The main technology stack (languages, frameworks, databases)
      3. How the code is organized (monorepo, feature folders, layers, etc.)
      4. Entry points and main flows
      5. Key configuration files that reveal architecture decisions

    user_template: |
      Repository: {repo_name}

      Directory structure:
      ```
      {directory_tree}
      ```

      Key files found:
      - package.json present: {has_package_json}
      - tsconfig.json present: {has_tsconfig}
      - Dockerfile present: {has_dockerfile}
      - docker-compose.yml present: {has_docker_compose}

      package.json contents (if present):
      ```json
      {package_json_content}
      ```

      Analyze this repository and provide:
      1. **Application Type**: What kind of application is this?
      2. **Tech Stack**: Languages, frameworks, databases, key dependencies
      3. **Architecture Pattern**: How is the code organized?
      4. **Entry Points**: Where does execution start?
      5. **Features/Modules**: List the main logical components
      6. **External Integrations**: What external services does this use?

      Return as JSON:
      ```json
      {
        "applicationType": "string",
        "techStack": {
          "languages": ["string"],
          "frameworks": ["string"],
          "databases": ["string"],
          "keyDependencies": ["string"]
        },
        "architecturePattern": "string",
        "entryPoints": [{"file": "string", "description": "string"}],
        "features": [{"name": "string", "path": "string", "description": "string"}],
        "externalIntegrations": [{"name": "string", "type": "string", "purpose": "string"}]
      }
      ```

  # ==========================================================================
  # PHASE 1.5: DISCOVER DOMAIN FEATURES (Business-Level)
  # ==========================================================================

  filter_features:
    system: |
      {base_system}

      You are identifying BUSINESS/DOMAIN FEATURES from a codebase - not just folders.

      A DOMAIN FEATURE is a distinct business capability or epic, such as:
      - Authentication (user login, registration, password reset)
      - User Management (CRUD operations on users)
      - Payments/Billing (transactions, subscriptions)
      - Notifications (email, push, in-app)
      - Admin Panel (administrative functions)
      - Frontend/UI (web or mobile user interface)
      - API Gateway (request routing, rate limiting)
      - Charity/Donations (charitable giving functionality)

      Your task:
      1. Identify ALL BUSINESS FEATURES this application implements
      2. Give each feature a proper BUSINESS NAME (e.g., "Authentication" not "auth-service")
      3. Map each feature to the code folder(s) that implement it
      4. Briefly describe what the feature does

      INCLUDE these as features:
      - Frontend/UI applications (React, Vue, Angular apps in frontend/, web/, client/)
      - API Gateway or routing services (api-gateway/, gateway/)
      - Shared libraries that provide reusable business logic

      EXCLUDE these from being features:
      - Test directories (tests/, __tests__)
      - Documentation (docs/)
      - Database migrations only (database/, migrations/)
      - Build artifacts (dist/, build/)
      - Configuration-only folders (config/, scripts/)
      - Project management (pm_artefacts/, notes/)
      - Container folders that ONLY hold other features (services/, packages/) - but DO include services within them

    user_template: |
      Repository: {repo_name}

      Discovered folders:
      {folder_list}

      Directory structure:
      ```
      {directory_tree}
      ```

      Identify the BUSINESS/DOMAIN FEATURES this application implements.

      For each feature, provide:
      - A proper business name (e.g., "Authentication", "Family Management", "Notifications")
      - The code path(s) that implement it
      - A brief description of what it does

      Return ONLY valid JSON (no explanations):
      ```json
      {
        "features": [
          {
            "name": "Authentication",
            "paths": ["services/auth-service"],
            "description": "User registration, login, password reset, and session management"
          },
          {
            "name": "Notifications",
            "paths": ["services/notification-service"],
            "description": "Email, push, and in-app notification delivery"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      IMPORTANT:
      - Use BUSINESS names (Authentication, not auth-service)
      - Group related functionality into single features
      - A feature can map to multiple code paths
      - Exclude utility folders (tests, docs, database, config, pm_artefacts)

  # PHASE 2: GENERATE README / ARCHITECTURE DOC
  # ==========================================================================

  generate_readme:
    system: |
      {base_system}

      Generate a comprehensive README.md that helps developers understand this codebase.
      The README should be practical and actionable, not just descriptive.

    user_template: |

      Analysis results:
      ```json
      {analysis_json}
      ```

      Directory structure:
      ```
      {directory_tree}
      ```

      Generate a README.md with these sections:

      # {repo_name}

      ## Overview
      Brief description of what this application does

      ## Architecture
      - System diagram (describe in text/ascii if helpful)

      - Key dependencies and why they're used

      ## Project Structure
      ```
      [folder tree with descriptions]
      ```

      ## Features/Modules
      For each feature:
      - Name and purpose
      - Location in codebase
      - Key files

      ## Getting Started
      - Prerequisites
      - Installation
      - Running locally

      ## API Overview
      High-level summary of APIs exposed (detailed in contracts)

      ## External Dependencies

  # ==========================================================================
  # PHASE 3: ANALYZE INDIVIDUAL FEATURES
  # ==========================================================================

  analyze_feature:
    system: |
      {base_system}

      You are performing deep analysis of a single feature/module.
      You must identify:

      **APIs EXPOSED (what this feature provides to others):**
      - HTTP endpoints (routes, handlers)
      - Exported functions and classes
      - Exported types and interfaces
      - Events emitted
      - WebSocket events sent

      **APIs CONSUMED (what this feature depends on):**
      - HTTP calls to external services
      - Imports from other internal features/modules
      - Database queries and operations
      - Message queue subscriptions
      - Events listened to

      Be specific about method signatures, parameters, and return types.
