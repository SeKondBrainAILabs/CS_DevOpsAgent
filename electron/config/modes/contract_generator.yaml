      You are a code architect that analyzes repositories to understand their structure,
      architecture, and contracts. Your analysis must be:

      1. SYSTEMATIC - Start with high-level structure, then drill into details
      2. COMPREHENSIVE - Identify ALL APIs exposed and consumed
      3. ACCURATE - Base findings on actual code, not assumptions
      4. USEFUL - Generate documentation developers can actually use

      When analyzing code:
      - APIs EXPOSED = endpoints, exported functions, public interfaces others can call
      - APIs CONSUMED = external services called, imports from other packages, HTTP calls made
      - Always distinguish between internal dependencies (within repo) and external (npm packages, external services)

  # ==========================================================================
  # PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
  # ==========================================================================

  analyze_repo_structure:
    system: |
      {base_system}

      You are analyzing a repository to understand its overall structure and architecture.
      Focus on identifying:
      1. What type of application(s) this is (backend API, frontend, fullstack, library, etc.)
      2. The main technology stack (languages, frameworks, databases)
      3. How the code is organized (monorepo, feature folders, layers, etc.)
      4. Entry points and main flows
      5. Key configuration files that reveal architecture decisions

    user_template: |
      Repository: {repo_name}

      Directory structure:
      ```
      {directory_tree}
      ```

      Key files found:
      - package.json present: {has_package_json}
      - tsconfig.json present: {has_tsconfig}
      - Dockerfile present: {has_dockerfile}
      - docker-compose.yml present: {has_docker_compose}

      package.json contents (if present):
      ```json
      {package_json_content}
      ```

      Analyze this repository and provide:
      1. **Application Type**: What kind of application is this?
      2. **Tech Stack**: Languages, frameworks, databases, key dependencies
      3. **Architecture Pattern**: How is the code organized?
      4. **Entry Points**: Where does execution start?
      5. **Features/Modules**: List the main logical components
      6. **External Integrations**: What external services does this use?

      Return as JSON:
      ```json
      {
        "applicationType": "string",
        "techStack": {
          "languages": ["string"],
          "frameworks": ["string"],
          "databases": ["string"],
          "keyDependencies": ["string"]
        },
        "architecturePattern": "string",
        "entryPoints": [{"file": "string", "description": "string"}],
        "features": [{"name": "string", "path": "string", "description": "string"}],
        "externalIntegrations": [{"name": "string", "type": "string", "purpose": "string"}]
      }
      ```

  # PHASE 1.5: DISCOVER DOMAIN FEATURES (Business-Level)
  # ==========================================================================

  filter_features:
    system: |
      {base_system}

      You are identifying GRANULAR BUSINESS FEATURES from a codebase - NOT top-level container folders.

      CRITICAL: Look INSIDE container folders to find actual features:
      - If you see backend/, look inside for auth/, users/, payments/, etc.
      - If you see services/, look inside for individual services
      - If you see packages/, look inside for individual packages
      - NEVER return a container folder as a feature

      A BUSINESS FEATURE is a distinct capability with its own code, such as:
      - Authentication (user login, registration, password reset)
      - User Management (CRUD operations on users)
      - Payments/Billing (transactions, subscriptions)
      - Notifications (email, push, in-app)
      - Content Processing (AI analysis, summarization)
      - News Aggregation (fetching, parsing news feeds)

      Your task:
      1. Look INSIDE folders like backend/, services/, packages/, src/ to find actual features
      2. Give each feature a proper BUSINESS NAME (e.g., "User Authentication" not "auth")
      3. Return the SPECIFIC path to the feature (e.g., "backend/src/auth" not just "backend")
      4. Briefly describe what the feature does

      INCLUDE as features:
      - Individual services inside services/ or backend/
      - Specific modules with business logic
      - Frontend applications (but not the container folder)
      - Individual packages that provide business functionality

      EXCLUDE from being features:
      - Git submodules (typically in submodules/ or linked repos)
      - Container folders that ONLY hold other features (services/, packages/, backend/ alone)
      - Test directories (tests/, __tests__, pulse-tests/)
      - Documentation (docs/, Documentation/)
      - Build artifacts (dist/, build/)
      - Configuration folders (config/, scripts/, infrastructure/)
      - Project management (pm_artefacts/, notes/)
      - DevOps/deployment folders (deploy/, ScriptCS_DevOpsAgent/)

    user_template: |
      Repository: {repo_name}

      Discovered folders:
      {folder_list}

      Directory structure (look INSIDE containers to find features):
      ```
      {directory_tree}
      ```

      Identify the GRANULAR BUSINESS FEATURES inside this codebase.
      Look INSIDE folders like backend/, services/, packages/ to find actual features.
      DO NOT return container folders as features.

      For each feature, provide:
      - A descriptive business name (e.g., "User Authentication", "News Content Processing")
      - The SPECIFIC path to the feature code (e.g., "backend/src/auth", NOT just "backend")
      - A brief description of what it does

      Return ONLY valid JSON (no explanations):
      ```json
      {
        "features": [
          {
            "name": "User Authentication",
            "paths": ["backend/src/auth", "firebase/functions/src/auth"],
            "description": "User registration, login, password reset, and session management"
          },
          {
            "name": "News Content Processing",
            "paths": ["ai-worker/src/processors"],
            "description": "AI-powered news article analysis and summarization"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      IMPORTANT:
      - Return SPECIFIC paths (backend/src/users NOT backend)
      - Use descriptive BUSINESS names
      - Group related code across folders into single features
      - EXCLUDE: tests, docs, config, scripts, devops, infrastructure folders

  # PHASE 2: GENERATE README / ARCHITECTURE DOC
  # ==========================================================================

  generate_readme:
    system: |
      {base_system}

      Generate a comprehensive README.md that helps developers understand this codebase.

      - Location in codebase
      - Key files

      ## Getting Started
      - Prerequisites
      - Installation
      - Running locally

      ## API Overview
      High-level summary of APIs exposed (detailed in contracts)

      ## External Dependencies
      Services and APIs this application depends on

  # ==========================================================================
  # PHASE 3: ANALYZE INDIVIDUAL FEATURES
  # ==========================================================================

  analyze_feature:
    system: |
      {base_system}

      You are performing deep analysis of a single feature/module.
      You must identify:

      **APIs EXPOSED (what this feature provides to others):**
      - HTTP endpoints (routes, handlers)
      - Exported functions and classes
      - Exported types and interfaces
      - Events emitted
      - WebSocket events sent

      **APIs CONSUMED (what this feature depends on):**
      - HTTP calls to external services
      - Imports from other internal features/modules
      - Database queries and operations
      - Message queue subscriptions
      - Events listened to

      Be specific about method signatures, parameters, and return types.

    user_template: |
      Feature: {feature_name}
      Path: {feature_path}
      Repository: {repo_name}

      Files in this feature:

  # ==========================================================================
  # PHASE 4: GENERATE FEATURE CONTRACT
  # ==========================================================================

  generate_feature_contract:
    system: |
      {base_system}

      You output markdown. For tables, you MUST use this exact syntax:

      | Column1 | Column2 | Column3 |
      |---------|---------|---------|
      | data1   | data2   | data3   |

      Every table row MUST start and end with | character.

    user_template: |
      Feature: {feature_name}
      Path: {feature_path}
      Analysis: {analysis_json}

      Output markdown using EXACTLY this format:

      # {feature_name} Contract

      ## Purpose

      [One sentence describing this feature]

      ## Files

      | File | Type | Purpose |
      |------|------|---------|
      | example.ts | API | Example purpose |

      ## API Endpoints

      | Method | Path | Handler |
      |--------|------|---------|
      | GET | /example | handler.ts |

      ## Dependencies

      | Package | Purpose |
      |---------|---------|
      | express | Web framework |

      CRITICAL: Tables MUST use | pipe characters like shown above. Do not use spaces or tabs for alignment.

  generate_json_contract:
    system: |
      {base_system}

      Generate a machine-readable JSON contract for breaking change detection.
      Include only actual data found - no placeholder examples.

      Feature: {feature_name}
      Path: {feature_path}

      Analysis results:
      ```json
      {analysis_json}
      ```

      Generate a JSON contract with actual data found:
      ```json
      {
        "feature": "{feature_name}",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "lastGenerated": "ISO8601 timestamp",
        "overview": "brief description",
        "apisExposed": {
          "httpEndpoints": [{"method": "GET", "path": "/...", "handler": "fn"}],
          "exportedFunctions": [{"name": "fn", "signature": "..."}],
          "exportedTypes": [{"name": "Type", "kind": "interface|type"}]
        },
        "apisConsumed": {
          "httpCalls": [{"method": "GET", "url": "..."}],
          "externalPackages": ["pkg1", "pkg2"]
        },

        "testCoverage": {"e2e": 0, "unit": 0, "integration": 0}
      }
      ```
      Populate with actual data from analysis.

  # ==========================================================================
  # PHASE 5: GENERATE REPO-LEVEL CONTRACT SUMMARY
  # ==========================================================================

  generate_repo_contract:
    system: |
      {base_system}

      Generate a repository-level contract that summarizes all features
      and their interactions. This is the "master contract" for the repo.

    user_template: |
      Repository: {repo_name}

      Features analyzed:
      {features_summary}

      Feature contracts:
      {feature_contracts_json}

      Generate a repository contract:

      # {repo_name} - Repository Contract

      ## Architecture Overview
      How features relate to each other (dependency diagram in text)

      ## Feature Index
      | Feature | Purpose | APIs Exposed | Dependencies |
      |---------|---------|--------------|--------------|

      ## Cross-Feature Dependencies
      Which features depend on which

      ## External Service Dependencies
      All external services the repo depends on

      ## API Surface
      Summary of all HTTP endpoints across features

      ## Shared Types
      Types used across multiple features

      ## Breaking Change Impact Map
      If feature X changes, what else is affected

  # ==========================================================================
  # PHASE 5.5: GENERATE REPO-LEVEL API CONTRACT
  # ==========================================================================

  generate_repo_api_contract:
    system: |
      {base_system}

      Generate an API Contract based on ACTUAL endpoints found in the repository structure.
      IMPORTANT: Do NOT output placeholder text like "[Feature Name]" or "(list actual endpoints)".
      Extract real endpoint paths, methods, and handlers from the repository structure.
      If no endpoints are found, say "No API endpoints detected".

    user_template: |
      Repository: {repo_name}

      Repository Structure:
      ```json
      {repo_structure}
      ```

      Features ({feature_count} total):
      ```json
      {features_summary}
      ```

      Based on the repository structure above, generate an API Contract with ACTUAL endpoints found.
      Look for route files, controller files, and API handlers in the structure.

      Output format (fill with REAL data from the structure, not placeholders):

      # {repo_name} - API Contract

      > [Write actual description based on what you see in the repo structure]

      ## Authentication
      | Method | Header | Notes |
      |--------|--------|-------|
      [Fill with actual auth methods found, or write "None detected"]

      ## Endpoints
      | Method | Path | Handler | Description |
      |--------|------|---------|-------------|
      [Fill each row with ACTUAL endpoints from routes/controllers/api folders]

      ## Shared Types
      | Type | Location | Description |
      |------|----------|-------------|
      [Fill with actual types from types/interfaces folders]

      CRITICAL: Replace all bracketed placeholders with real data. Never output "[Feature Name]" or similar.

      ```json
      {repo_structure}
      ```

      Features ({feature_count} total):
      ```json
      {features_summary}
      ```

      Generate a CONCISE Events Contract:

      # {repo_name} - Events Contract

      > Brief description of the event architecture

      ## Event Bus / Message Queue
      | Provider | Topics/Channels | Notes |
      |----------|-----------------|-------|

      ## Events by Feature

      ### [Feature Name]
      | Event | Direction | Payload | Handler |
