Branch: claude-session-20260129-2m6m-S9N-923
Task: S9N-923 - Fix rebase verification, merge data loss, and commit history bugs

## Files to Re-read After Compaction
1. This file: .claude-session-17696868.md
2. House rules: houserules.md
3. File locks: .file-coordination/active-edits/

## Progress (update as you work)
- [x] Task started
- [x] Files identified
- [x] Implementation complete
- [x] Testing complete (code review only - no lint config)
- [x] Ready for commit

## Key Findings
- Rebase returns "success" without verifying actual changes - FIXED
- MergeService.executeMerge() never commits uncommitted changes before merge - FIXED (CRITICAL DATA LOSS BUG)
- getCommitHistory() shows "0 files" because git adds blank line between commit info and stats - FIXED

## Files Modified
1. electron/services/GitService.ts - Rebase verification (HEAD before/after) + commit history fix (skip blank lines)
2. electron/services/MergeService.ts - CRITICAL: Add auto-commit before merge to prevent data loss
3. electron/ipc/index.ts - Activity logging for rebase operations
4. electron/preload.ts - Updated return types for performRebase
5. renderer/components/features/SessionDetailView.tsx - Error popup for sync failures

## Notes
- This is a re-implementation of session 17696852 which was lost due to the merge data loss bug we just fixed
- The merge bug was critical - it caused user's uncommitted changes to be lost when merging
