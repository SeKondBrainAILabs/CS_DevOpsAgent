## Progress (update as you work)
- [x] Task started
- [x] Files identified
- [x] Implementation complete
- [ ] Testing complete
- [ ] Ready for commit

## Changes Made
1. **electron/services/ContractGenerationService.ts** (line 236-255)
   - Reduced IGNORE_FOLDERS from 20+ entries to just `.git`
   - Everything else should be controlled by .gitignore and .gitmodules

2. **electron/config/modes/contract_generator.yaml** (lines 206-212, 287)
   - Changed AI prompt exclusion rules to only exclude gitmodules and gitignore
   - Removed automatic exclusion of tests, docs, config, scripts, devops

3. **ai-backend/src/config/modes/contract_generator.yaml** (same changes)
   - Synced changes with electron version

## Key Findings
- Feature scanning had 3 layers of filtering that were too aggressive
- User wants control over what's excluded - only trust .gitmodules and .gitignore

## Notes
- User will manually label features as submodules if needed
- This allows tests, docs, vendor, external, etc. to be discovered as features
